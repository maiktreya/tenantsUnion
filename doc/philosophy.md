# ⚡ Database-Centric Architecture: An Executive Summary

## The Premise

Most business apps are just structured data with CRUD operations. Yet we often bury them under ORMs, boilerplate APIs, and overengineered layers.

This manifesto proposes a **pragmatic, database-first stack**:

* **PostgreSQL** → the application’s computational core
* **PostgREST** → instant, zero-boilerplate API from the schema
* **NiceGUI (+ FastAPI)** → Python-native UI, with FastAPI as an escape hatch

The result: faster delivery, fewer moving parts, and stronger guarantees.

## Why It Works

### 1. Database = The Heart ❤️

* Schema is the single source of truth.
* Constraints, triggers, and functions enforce integrity at the deepest layer.
* Business logic runs next to the data for performance and reliability.

### 2. Zero-Boilerplate API 🚀

* CRUD endpoints generated automatically.
* Add a column → it’s in the API.
* Add a view → instant read-only endpoint.
* Devs focus on real business value, not plumbing.

### 3. Simplicity as Robustness ⚙️

* Fewer layers = less code, less overhead, less debugging.
* Runtime is lean Postgres + a stateless PostgREST server.
* Config-driven validation with minimalistic schema mapping.
* Minimal full CRUD  API client with flexible generics.
* Singletons for a centralized async API & a reactive state managements +

## Escape Hatch Pragmatism 🛠️

Not all problems are CRUD. For integrations, workflows, or heavy computations:

* **NiceGUI** delivers rapid UI in Python.
* **FastAPI** is always there for custom endpoints, advanced auth, or third-party APIs.
* Hybrid model: 80% handled by Postgres + PostgREST, 20% by FastAPI when needed.

## Real-World Example

A tenant-union system runs on:

```yaml
services:
  db: PostgreSQL with triggers/functions
  server: PostgREST API
  nicegui-app: Python UI (+ FastAPI auth)
    extras:
      - nginx: security + reverse proxy (with ufw for host-level firewall)
      - certbot: SSL certs via cronjob (automated renewal)
```

**Results:** 15+ tables → 15+ endpoints, instant UI updates from schema changes, secure & production-ready with Docker + firewall.

## Who This Is For 🎯

✅ CRUD-heavy apps (dashboards, membership systems, internal tools)
✅ Small/medium teams who value speed & simplicity
✅ Devs comfortable with SQL/Postgres

⚠️ Risky for:

* Large enterprises with rigid separation of concerns
* Teams who avoid SQL and prefer frontend-first workflows

## The Core Question

Instead of asking:

> *Which ORM should we use?*

Ask instead:

> *How much can Postgres do for us—and what’s the simplest way to handle the rest?*
